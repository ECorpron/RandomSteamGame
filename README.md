# RandomSteamGame
A project where a user can provide a public steam id and be given a random game in their catalogue to play.

# Future Potential Features
* logging in through steam so that users dont have to provide steam IDs
* filtering options to restrict the kinds of games that will show up
* Being able to sort games by most common achievment not yet acquired by the user (I'm a bit of an achievment hunter so this would be for me)
